"""
Conceptual Demonstration of Shor's Algorithm Structure for ECDLP using Qiskit.

This script implements the structural components outlined in the essay
"Solving Discrete Logarithm Problems in ECDH Using Qiskit".
It uses the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 7 over the finite field F_17.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This script uses a placeholder for the complex quantum
elliptic curve point multiplication required by a real Shor's algorithm
implementation for ECDLP. The CX gates used are purely illustrative of
the algorithm's *structure* and DO NOT perform actual elliptic curve
arithmetic. Therefore, the results are conceptual and cannot be used
to determine the discrete logarithm 'k'.
